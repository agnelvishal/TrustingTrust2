Source code is at https://github.com/agnelvishal/TrustingTrust

Hackhands?

Hi. I hope I am not disturbing you. The page https://agnelvishal.github.io/TrustingTrust/ is zoomed in firefox for android and in full screen mode in chrome for android Source code is at https://github.com/agnelvishal/TrustingTrust Can you tell why is it so?



 Already made
Text
1) If footer is used, then The word "Available translations" instead of "fan-translations".
2) Removed "by nicky case" in words.html


UI
1) Removed footer in i) slides.css  ii) main.js iii) index.html.
a) Also removed slideSelect in main.js and index.html(including library)
b) Removed sound control in main.js and index.html.
2) Since footer removed, height of #main in slides.css is made 100%
3) Compressed and trimmed bg audio.



Yet to be made
Should learn css basics
Need to change to landscape mode. Maybe manifest can be used for that.  https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/fullscreen/
Intro text can be shown in loading screen.

Need to modify css when full screen. Maybe it is becoming responsive in full screen mode.Need to see and experiemtn with meta viewport. Maybe particular element needs to be selected for fullsceen.
See if there are resources which are loaded but not needed in my version.
Need to add sandbox mode (not sure about game mode) or all slides at first screen except at first load. Maybe file storage needs to be used.
Multiplayer looks nice idea
Fullscreen and zoom(user-scalable) needs to be provided in native app.
Use minify(remove comments, white space),cdn, webP image format and other compression techniques. Remove unncessaey css etc.
See if sharing is needed or not. If needed then maybe present at last page.

Note
Focus first on css. Then focus on modified words(text)

Phonegap, Gonative and webview in android studio can be tried. (Maybe app can be rejected if webview in android studio is used as hardware apis are not needed). Gonative pricing is high.
So native may not be needed like pwa. Actually I have no reason why it should ne native(other than psycological). Being web has advangages of sharability.
