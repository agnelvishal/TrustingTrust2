Yet to be made
Need to change to landscape mode.
Intro text can be shown in loading screen.

See why zoomed in full screen.
See if there are resources which are loaded but not needed in my version.
Need to add sandbox mode (not sure about game mode) or all slides at first screen except at first load. Maybe file storage needs to be used.
Multiplayer looks nice idea
Fullscreen and zoom(user-scalable) needs to be provided in native app.
Use minify(remove comments, white space),cdn, webP image format and other compression techniques. Remove unncessaey css etc.
See if sharing is needed or not. If needed then maybe present at last page.

Note
Focus first on css. Then focus on modified words(text)

Phonegap, Gonative and webview in android studio can be tried. (Maybe app can be rejected if webview in android studio is used as hardware apis are not needed). Gonative pricing is high.
So native may not be needed like pwa. Actually I have no reason why it should ne native(other than psycological). Being web has advangages of sharability.
