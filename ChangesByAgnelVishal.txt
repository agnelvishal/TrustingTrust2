Yet to be made
Need to change to landscape mode.
See if there are resources which are loaded but not needed in my version.
Need to add sandbox mode (not sure about game mode) at first screen except ar first load. Maybe file storage needs to be used.
Multiplayer looks nice idea
Fullscreen and zoom(user-scalable) needs to be provided in native app.
Use minify,cdn, webP image format and other compression techniques

Note
Focus first on css. Then focus on modified words(text)

Phonegap, Gonative and webview in android studio can be tried. (Maybe app can be rejected if webview in android studio is used as hardware apis are not needed). Gonative pricing is high.
So native may not be needed like pwa
